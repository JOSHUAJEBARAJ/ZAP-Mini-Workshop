    "## ZAP Mini Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abhay Bhargav - we45\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "Over the last 2 years, I have worked with and implemented several SAST and DAST tools as part of a Continuous Delivery Pipeline. In this time, I have seen that there are few tools that match the flexibility and capabilities of OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy, especially from the perspective of integrating into a Continuous Delivery Pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of training programs that I have delivered at OWASP AppSecUSA, EU and DEFCON, I have trained several folks on OWASP ZAP's API and Scripting features. This is a shorter version of the same training program that I have delivered in these places. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this is as follows: \n",
    "- To get someone quickly up and running with ZAP and its feature-rich API and Scripting Features\n",
    "- To NOT use presentations. It takes FOREVER prepping presentation. Writing everything in Markdown and Python is far easier\n",
    "- To cover essential functionality that I think would be useful to folks. I am sure I will be missing some cool features here. Please bear with me\n",
    "- To reference some other useful tools and libraries that I have been working with, either ZAP related or otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "- Python 3.6.1\n",
    "- Please install all requirements from `requirements.txt`. This includes ZAP's Python API\n",
    "- Download and Install ZAP 2.7.0 (Download from (here)[https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads])\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warnings\n",
    "This code is given to you as is, where is. I don't take any responsibility for how/where you use it. This is NOT production ready in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thanks\n",
    "- I would like to thank Simon Bennetts (@psiinon) and the rest of the OWASP ZAP Development Team. They do a truly admirable job of maintaining and managing ZAP for all of us. \n",
    "- I would like to thank a few members of my amazing team! - Nithin, Sharath and Tilak. Thanks for all that you do\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Useful Projects\n",
    "- ZAP Robot Framework Integration - https://bitbucket.org/we45abhay/robozap\n",
    "- Vulnerable App used in this exercise - https://bitbucket.org/we45abhay/defcon_vul_app/\n",
