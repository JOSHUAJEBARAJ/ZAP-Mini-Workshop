# OWASP ZAP 2.7.0 Mini Workshop

## Install Instructions

* Download ZAP 2.7.0 from [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads)
* Clone the `git clone https://github.com/we45/ZAP-Mini-Workshop`
* I'd highly recommend using a `virtualenv` here
	* `cd ZAP-Mini-Workshop`
	* `virtualenv zap`
	* `source zap/bin/activate`
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start the IPython Notebook with `ipython notebook`. This should start the notebook and your default browser should automatically redirect you to the iPython Notebook
* Open the `ZAP 2.7.0 Mini Workshop.ipynb`, by clicking on it.
* We'll go over the rest at the workshop :)
